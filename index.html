		<h1 >Hero's Attributes</h1>
		<p>A hero's attributes determine most scaling statistics independently. As a hero levels up, acquires talents, purchases items, or uses abilities, they gain attributes.</p>
		
		<div class="row" >
		  <div class="course-col"><img src="agility.png" alt="symbol agility">	
		    <h3 style="color: #2ef948;">Agility </h3>
			  <p>Agility heroes are the only class of heroes to gain both damage and attack speed as their primary attribute increases. They tend to have the highest physical damage output as the game progresses.<br><br> In short, they are very good for offensive items. Most of their abilities enhance or serve as mechanisms for positioning or escaping; most of their abilities do not disable them.</p>
		  </div>
			
		  <div class="course-col"><img src="strength.png" alt="symbol strength">	
		    <h3 style="color: #f92e2e;">Strength </h3>
			  <p>Strength heroes tend to have more health and health regeneration than other heroes, making them more resilient to both physical attacks and spells. Strength heroes can play a variety of roles, such as carry, ganker, and support.<br><br> Their initiation is usually strong, and they behave somewhat like tanks. Heros with a large amount of strength can also significantly increase the amount of damage needed to bring down a team.</p>
		  </div>
			
		  <div class="course-col"><img src="intelligence.png" alt="symbol intelligence">	
		    <h3 style="color: #2e6af9;">Intelligence </h3>
			  <p>Intelligence heroes tend to have a greater number of active abilities compared to other heroes; all intelligence heroes have at least three active abilities, with a large number of them having all four of their abilities being active, and some even having 5 or more.<br><br> These abilities are used frequently because of their larger mana pools and higher mana regeneration rates. Heroes with disabling abilities, such as intelligence heroes, are essential in most lineups due to their large number.</p>

		<p>There are hundreds of heroes in Dota 2, ranging from magical tacticians to fierce brutes and cunning rogues.<br> Make use of your unique abilities to take down your opponents.</p>
